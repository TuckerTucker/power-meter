# Agent Team Design for Project Management Commands

## Overview
This document outlines a focused agent team design that replaces the existing monolithic commands (`context_prime`, `knowledge_graph_update`, `project_yaml_update`, `repo_review`) with specialized, task-focused agents for better modularity and parallel execution.

## Current Command Analysis

### Common Tasks Identified
1. **Project Analysis & Understanding**: Review codebase structure and components
2. **Documentation & Context**: Check project docs and architectural decisions  
3. **Context7 Integration**: Find library documentation IDs and map dependencies
4. **State Synchronization**: Update documentation to match implementation reality
5. **Business & Technical Context**: Map requirements to implementation

## Proposed Agent Team (8 Agents)

### Agent 1: Project Structure Analyzer
**Purpose**: Maps directory organization and file relationships
**Tasks**:
- Analyze directory tree and file organization
- Identify entry points, key components, and modules
- Document architecture patterns and naming conventions
- Map component dependencies and relationships

**Outputs**:
- Structure map with component relationships
- Component inventory with descriptions
- Architecture pattern documentation
- Entry point and flow analysis

### Agent 2: Knowledge Graph Manager
**Purpose**: Updates MCP knowledge graph with persistent memory
**Tasks**:
- Create/update entities for components, concepts, requirements
- Map relationships between project elements
- Add observations about technical and business insights
- Maintain graph integrity and clean outdated information

**Outputs**:
- Updated knowledge graph entities
- Relationship mappings
- Structured observations
- Graph validation reports

### Agent 3: Documentation Synchronizer
**Purpose**: Updates project documentation to match implementation
**Tasks**:
- Update `_project.yml` with current project state
- Synchronize README and architectural docs
- Validate documentation accuracy against codebase
- Maintain consistent formatting and structure

**Outputs**:
- Updated `_project.yml` file
- Synchronized documentation files
- Documentation validation report
- Format compliance check

### Agent 4: Context7 Library Mapper
**Purpose**: Identifies dependencies and finds Context7 documentation IDs
**Tasks**:
- Scan package files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
- Identify all project dependencies and frameworks
- Resolve Context7 documentation IDs for libraries
- Maintain library-to-documentation mappings

**Outputs**:
- Dependency inventory with versions
- Context7 ID mappings
- Library documentation references
- Technology stack documentation

### Agent 5: Security & Quality Scanner
**Purpose**: Performs security and code quality assessment
**Tasks**:
- Scan for security vulnerabilities and patterns
- Assess code quality metrics and standards
- Identify anti-patterns and potential issues
- Check for sensitive data exposure

**Outputs**:
- Security vulnerability report
- Code quality metrics
- Best practices compliance
- Issue prioritization recommendations

### Agent 6: Business Context Extractor
**Purpose**: Maps technical implementation to business requirements
**Tasks**:
- Extract project goals and objectives from documentation
- Identify user stories and business requirements
- Map features to business value
- Document stakeholder concerns and priorities

**Outputs**:
- Business-technical mapping
- Requirements analysis
- Feature-value alignment
- Stakeholder context documentation

### Agent 7: Technical Debt Assessor
**Purpose**: Identifies improvement opportunities and technical debt
**Tasks**:
- Scan for TODOs, FIXMEs, and code comments
- Identify performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- Assess refactoring needs and architectural improvements
- Prioritize technical debt by impact and effort

**Outputs**:
- Technical debt inventory
- Improvement recommendations
- Priority matrix for fixes
- Refactoring opportunity analysis

### Agent 8: Report Consolidator
**Purpose**: Aggregates findings and generates comprehensive reports
**Tasks**:
- Collect outputs from all specialized agents
- Generate executive summary with key findings
- Create comprehensive consolidated report
- Build navigation indexes and cross-references

**Outputs**:
- Executive summary report
- Consolidated comprehensive report
- Navigation index
- Cross-referenced findings

## Agent Execution Strategy

### Parallel Execution
- **Phase 1**: Agents 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 run in parallel (data gathering)
- **Phase 2**: Agent 2 (Knowledge Graph) and Agent 3 (Documentation) run with Phase 1 outputs
- **Phase 3**: Agent 8 (Consolidator) aggregates all findings

### Dependencies
- Agent 2 depends on Agent 1 (structure analysis)
- Agent 3 depends on Agents 1, 4, 6 (structure, deps, business context)
- Agent 8 depends on all other agents (consolidation)

### Coordination
- Shared configuration file for all agents
- Standardized output formats for integration
- Progress tracking and status reporting
- Error handling and graceful degradation

## Benefits of This Design

### Modularity
- Each agent has a single, well-defined responsibility
- Easier to maintain, test, and extend individual agents
- Clear separation of concerns

### Parallel Efficiency
- Maximum parallelization of independent tasks
- Reduced overall execution time
- Better resource utilization

### Specialized Expertise
- Each agent can use specialized tools and techniques
- Focused optimization for specific analysis types
- Easier to add domain-specific improvements

### Maintainability
- Smaller, focused codebases per agent
- Independent testing and validation
- Easier debugging and troubleshooting

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Agents
Implement Agents 1, 2, 3 (structure, knowledge graph, documentation)

### Phase 2: Analysis Agents  
Add Agents 4, 5, 7 (libraries, security/quality, technical debt)

### Phase 3: Context & Consolidation
Complete with Agents 6, 8 (business context, consolidation)

### Phase 4: Integration
Replace existing monolithic commands with agent orchestration

## Implementation Considerations

- **Agent Communication**: Standardized JSON/YAML data exchange formats
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when individual agents fail
- **Configuration**: Centralized configuration with agent-specific overrides
- **Monitoring**: Progress tracking and execution metrics
- **Caching**: Intelligent caching to avoid redundant analysis
- **Validation**: Output validation and quality checks for each agent

This design provides comprehensive coverage of all existing command functionality while offering improved modularity, maintainability, and execution efficiency.
