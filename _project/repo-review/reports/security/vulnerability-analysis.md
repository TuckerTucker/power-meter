# Power Meter Security Vulnerability Analysis

## Executive Summary

This security assessment of the Go-based power meter pulse counter reveals **critical security vulnerabilities** that pose significant risks to system security, data privacy, and service availability. The application requires immediate security remediation before production deployment.

### Risk Assessment
- **Overall Security Score**: 3.2/10 (High Risk)
- **Critical Issues**: 3
- **High Severity Issues**: 4  
- **Total Vulnerabilities**: 11
- **Immediate Action Required**: Yes

### Key Security Concerns
1. **Unauthenticated network exposure** allowing unrestricted access to power consumption data
2. **Denial of service vulnerabilities** through connection exhaustion attacks
3. **Privilege escalation risks** from running with root privileges
4. **Data privacy violations** through plaintext transmission and verbose logging

## Critical Vulnerabilities

### 1. Unauthenticated TCP Server Exposure (CRITICAL)
**File**: `power-meter.go:63`  
**CVSS Score**: 7.5

The TCP server binds to `0.0.0.0:9001` without any authentication mechanism, exposing power consumption data to any network-accessible client.

```go
lis, err := net.Listen("tcp", host+":"+port) // Binds to 0.0.0.0:9001
```

**Attack Scenario**: An attacker can connect to port 9001 from anywhere on the network to gather detailed power consumption data, enabling:
- Household activity surveillance
- Occupancy pattern analysis  
- Privacy invasion through power consumption profiling

**Remediation**:
- Implement API key authentication
- Use TLS client certificates
- Bind to `127.0.0.1` only if remote access isn't required
- Add IP whitelisting for authorized clients

### 2. Denial of Service via Connection Exhaustion (CRITICAL)
**File**: `power-meter.go:79`  
**CVSS Score**: 7.1

The server creates unlimited goroutines for each incoming connection without any rate limiting or resource management.

```go
go func() { // New goroutine per connection without limits
    c := make(chan int)
    counter.Query <- c
    value := <-c
    conn.Write([]byte(fmt.Sprintf("%d", value)))
    conn.Close()
}()
```

**Attack Scenario**: An attacker can open thousands of concurrent connections, exhausting system memory and causing service crash.

**Remediation**:
- Implement connection limits (max concurrent connections)
- Add connection timeouts
- Use a worker pool pattern instead of unlimited goroutines
- Implement rate limiting per IP address

### 3. Privileged GPIO Access Without Privilege Dropping (CRITICAL)
**File**: `power-meter.go:98`  
**CVSS Score**: 8.8

The application requires root privileges for GPIO access but never drops privileges after initialization.

```go
watcher := gpio.NewWatcher() // Requires root for GPIO access
watcher.AddPin(INPUT_PIN)
```

**Attack Scenario**: If any other vulnerability is exploited, the attacker gains root access instead of limited user privileges, enabling complete system compromise.

**Remediation**:
- Drop privileges to a dedicated user after GPIO initialization
- Use GPIO access delegation through a privileged daemon
- Implement capability-based security for GPIO access

## High Severity Vulnerabilities

### 4. Process Termination on Accept Errors (HIGH)
**File**: `power-meter.go:75`  
**CVSS Score**: 6.5

Server terminates the entire process on TCP accept errors instead of graceful error handling.

```go
if nil != err {
    fmt.Println("Error on accept: ", err.Error())
    os.Exit(1) // FIXME should not Exit() here
}
```

**Impact**: Single network error crashes the entire power monitoring service.

### 5. Race Condition in Counter Access (HIGH)
**File**: `power-meter.go:40-51`  
**CVSS Score**: 5.9

The counter implementation lacks proper synchronization for concurrent access between GPIO updates and network queries.

**Impact**: Potential data races leading to incorrect counter values or memory corruption under high load.

### 6. Unbounded Counter Growth (HIGH)
**File**: `power-meter.go:47`  
**CVSS Score**: 5.3

Counter value can grow infinitely without bounds checking or overflow protection.

```go
value++ // No bounds checking on counter increment
```

**Impact**: Integer overflow after prolonged operation leading to incorrect readings.

### 7. Connection Resource Leak (HIGH)
**File**: `power-meter.go:84`  
**CVSS Score**: 5.8

TCP connections may not be properly closed in all error scenarios.

**Impact**: Connection leaks leading to file descriptor exhaustion and service degradation.

## Medium Severity Vulnerabilities

### 8. Sensitive Information Disclosure in Logs (MEDIUM)
**File**: `power-meter.go:105`  
**CVSS Score**: 4.3

Application logs detailed GPIO pin values and timing information that could reveal activity patterns.

```go
fmt.Printf("%s : (epoch %d) : read %d from gpio %d\n", time.Now(), time.Now().Unix(), value, pin)
```

**Privacy Impact**: Log files expose household activity patterns through power consumption timing.

### 9. Missing TLS Encryption (MEDIUM)
**File**: `power-meter.go:83`  
**CVSS Score**: 5.9

TCP server transmits power consumption data in plaintext without encryption.

**Impact**: Network traffic interception reveals power consumption patterns for surveillance.

### 10. No Input Validation on GPIO Pin Configuration (MEDIUM)
**File**: `power-meter.go:13`  
**CVSS Score**: 4.1

GPIO pin number is hardcoded without validation.

**Impact**: Invalid GPIO pin access could interfere with other system components.

## Attack Vectors Analysis

### Network-Based Attacks
1. **Data Harvesting**: Unauthenticated access to power consumption data
2. **Denial of Service**: Connection flooding to exhaust system resources
3. **Traffic Analysis**: Passive monitoring of plaintext network communications
4. **Service Disruption**: Malformed packets to trigger service crashes

### Local Attacks
1. **Privilege Escalation**: Exploiting root GPIO access for system compromise
2. **Hardware Interference**: GPIO pin manipulation affecting other components
3. **Activity Surveillance**: Log file analysis for occupancy pattern extraction
4. **Resource Exhaustion**: Local connection flooding attacks

### Privacy Attacks
1. **Household Surveillance**: Power consumption pattern analysis
2. **Occupancy Detection**: Activity timing through power usage correlation
3. **Device Fingerprinting**: Identifying specific appliances through power signatures
4. **Behavioral Profiling**: Long-term activity pattern establishment

- Use systemd user units instead of root execution
- Implement proper file permissions and access controls
- Add SELinux or AppArmor policies for additional protection

### Data Protection

- Comply with privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA)

### Monitoring and Incident Response
- Implement comprehensive security logging
- Add real-time monitoring for suspicious activities
- Create incident response procedures
- Establish security update procedures

## Conclusion

The power meter application contains multiple critical security vulnerabilities that must be addressed before production deployment. The combination of unauthenticated network exposure, privilege escalation risks, and denial of service vulnerabilities creates a significant security threat.

**Immediate action is required** to implement basic security controls, particularly authentication, privilege management, and resource protection. The privacy implications of power consumption data exposure also necessitate strong encryption and access controls.

A phased remediation approach should prioritize the most critical vulnerabilities while establishing a foundation for long-term security maintenance and monitoring.
