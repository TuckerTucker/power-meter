# Dependency Security Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

The power meter Go project presents **significant dependency security risks** due to its use of legacy GOPATH-based dependency management and reliance on an unverified external GPIO library. The project lacks fundamental dependency security controls including version pinning, integrity verification, and automated vulnerability scanning.

**Risk Score: 3.2/10** (Critical Risk Level)

## Key Security Findings

### Critical Issues
- **No Go Modules**: Project uses legacy GOPATH mode without dependency version management
- **Supply Chain Risk**: Single external dependency from unverified individual maintainer
- **No Integrity Verification**: Dependencies downloaded without checksum validation

### Major Concerns
- Hardware-level GPIO access without security audit
- Cross-compilation security gaps for ARM targets
- No automated vulnerability scanning

## Dependency Inventory

### External Dependencies
```
github.com/brian-armstrong/gpio
├── Version: Unknown (no version pinning)
├── Maintainer: Individual GitHub user (brian-armstrong)
├── License: Unknown/Unverified
├── Last Security Audit: None
├── Supply Chain Risk: HIGH
└── Functionality: GPIO pin access and monitoring
```

### Standard Library Dependencies
```go
fmt     // String formatting - Standard Go library
net     // Network operations - TCP server functionality  
os      // Operating system interface - Process control
time    // Time operations - Timestamp generation
```

## Security Risk Assessment

### Supply Chain Vulnerabilities

#### 1. Dependency Management (CRITICAL)
- **Issue**: No go.mod file - using legacy GOPATH mode
- **Impact**: 
  - Cannot track or pin dependency versions
  - Vulnerable to dependency confusion attacks
  - No transitive dependency visibility
  - Build reproducibility issues
- **Remediation**: Initialize Go modules immediately

#### 2. brian-armstrong/gpio Library (CRITICAL)
- **Repository**: https://github.com/brian-armstrong/gpio
- **Maintainer**: Individual GitHub user (not organization)
- **Security Assessment**: 
  - No published security audit
  - Individual maintainer poses account compromise risk
  - Hardware-level access capabilities
  - Unknown license compatibility
- **Risk Factors**:
  - Account takeover potential
  - Malicious code injection risk
  - Hardware privilege escalation
  - No organizational security backing

#### 3. Build System Security (HIGH)
- **Cross-compilation**: ARM6 target without architecture-specific validation
- **Dependencies**: Downloaded at build time without verification
- **Integrity**: No checksum validation (go.sum missing)

## Vulnerability Analysis

### Known CVE Research
**No specific CVEs identified** for the GPIO library due to:
- Lack of version information
- Limited security research on individual-maintained libraries
- No CVE database coverage for this specific package

### Potential Vulnerability Classes
1. **Privilege Escalation**: GPIO access requires elevated permissions
2. **Hardware Exploitation**: Direct hardware pin manipulation
3. **Denial of Service**: GPIO watcher resource exhaustion
4. **Supply Chain Injection**: Unverified dependency updates

## License Compliance Analysis

### Project License
- **Type**: BSD 3-Clause License
- **Commercial Use**: Permitted
- **Distribution**: Requires license preservation

### Dependency License Issues
- **GPIO Library**: License unknown/unverified
- **Compliance Risk**: Potential license incompatibility
- **Recommendation**: Verify GPIO library license before distribution

## Security Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Critical Priority)

1. **Migrate to Go Modules**
   ```bash
   go mod init power-meter
   go mod tidy
   ```

2. **Pin GPIO Dependency Version**
   ```bash
   go get github.com/brian-armstrong/gpio@specific-commit-hash
   ```

3. **Implement Integrity Verification**
   - Commit go.sum file for dependency checksums
   - Enable GOSUMDB for supply chain verification

### Short-term Improvements

1. **Evaluate Alternative GPIO Libraries**
   - Consider `periph.io/x/periph` (organization-backed)
   - Evaluate `golang.org/x/exp/io/spi` for SPI interfaces
   - Assess custom GPIO implementation using `/sys/class/gpio`

2. **Add Security Scanning**
   ```makefile
   security-scan:
   	govulncheck ./...
   	go list -m all | nancy sleuth
   ```

3. **Implement Build Security**
   ```makefile
   build-secure:
   	go mod verify
   	go build -trimpath -buildmode=pie ./...
   ```

### Long-term Security Strategy

1. **Dependency Security Monitoring**
   - Integrate Dependabot or similar for vulnerability alerts
   - Regular dependency updates and security patches
   - Automated security scanning in CI/CD

2. **Hardware Security Controls**
   - Implement least-privilege GPIO access
   - Add hardware access logging and monitoring
   - Validate GPIO pin configurations securely

3. **Supply Chain Hardening**
   - Use dependency proxy/mirror for controlled downloads
   - Implement software bill of materials (SBOM)
   - Regular security audits of dependencies

## Cross-Platform Security Considerations

### ARM Compilation Security
```makefile
# Current build (insecure)
GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm GOARM=6 go build -o power-meter.pi power-meter.go

# Recommended secure build
GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm GOARM=6 go build -trimpath -buildmode=pie -o power-meter.pi
```

### Target Platform Risks
- **Raspberry Pi Deployment**: Default privileged access for GPIO
- **ARM6 Architecture**: Limited security features compared to newer ARM versions
- **Linux Permissions**: Requires root or gpio group membership

## Compliance and Governance

### Security Controls Needed
- [ ] Dependency version management (go.mod)
- [ ] Integrity verification (go.sum)
- [ ] License compliance verification
- [ ] Automated vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Supply chain security monitoring
- [ ] Hardware access controls

### Audit Trail Requirements
- Track all dependency updates with security justification
- Document GPIO library security assessment
- Maintain security scanning results
- Log hardware access patterns

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1 (Critical)
- Initialize Go modules
- Pin GPIO dependency version
- Implement basic integrity verification

### Week 2-3 (High Priority)
- Audit GPIO library security
- Evaluate alternative libraries
- Add automated security scanning

### Month 2 (Medium Priority)
- Implement hardware access controls
- Add comprehensive monitoring
- Establish dependency update procedures

### Ongoing
- Regular security scans
- Dependency updates
- Security monitoring and alerting

## Conclusion

The power meter project requires immediate attention to address critical dependency security gaps. The combination of legacy dependency management, unverified external libraries, and hardware-level access creates a high-risk security profile. 

**Priority actions**: Migrate to Go modules, verify GPIO library security, and implement dependency integrity verification before any production deployment.

**Long-term success** depends on establishing proper dependency governance, automated security scanning, and ongoing supply chain monitoring to maintain security posture as the project evolves.
