## Implementation Guidelines

### Success Factors
1. **Executive Commitment**: Quality improvements need protected time
2. **Incremental Approach**: Parallel development minimizes disruption
3. **Hardware Testing**: All changes validated on target platform
4. **Monitoring First**: Observability before optimization

### Common Pitfalls
1. **Feature Pressure**: Avoid adding features during debt remediation
2. **Big Bang Migration**: Incremental changes reduce deployment risk
3. **Testing Shortcuts**: Comprehensive testing is investment, not cost
4. **Documentation Neglect**: Knowledge transfer is critical for sustainability

### Quality Gates
- **Phase 1**: No critical issues remain before proceeding
- **Phase 2**: Test coverage >60% before architecture changes
- **Phase 3**: Performance validation before production deployment
- **Final**: Security audit and operational readiness review
